# TCAS-Digital-Twin
This project simulates a minimal Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for aircraft. It demonstrates real-time tracking and advisory mechanisms for safety-critical systems using MATLAB.
# (a) Project Scope
This project simulates a minimal Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for aircraft. It demonstrates real-time tracking and advisory mechanisms for safety-critical systems using MATLAB.
# (b) Major Software Functions
Aircraft initialization with 3D position and velocity


Real-time simulation of aircraft motion


Conflict detection based on predefined thresholds


Traffic Advisory (TA) and Resolution Advisory (RA) logic


Visualization of aircraft with warnings


# (c) Performance/Behavior Issues
Simulation should run in near-real-time


Scalable architecture for varying traffic density


# (d) Safety, Security, and Reliability Targets
Safety threshold alerts based on defined proximity limits 0.48 NM and 850 ft for TA, 0.35 NM and 600 ft for RA)


Minimal reliability model due to the simulation's academic nature


Offline execution for simplified security


# (e) Management and Technical Constraints
All work must be done using MATLAB


Teamwork with division of simulation, visualization, and documentation roles
